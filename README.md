For this practicum, add and test an equals method that properly
compares Fraction values, for the Fraction class given. The equals
method must return true if two fractions are ARITHMETICALLY equal.

- `Complete the Fraction.java class` by filling in the equals method.
- `Complete the main` by replacing each `<complete>` with `==` or call
  `equals` method.
- `Test the program` and correct any syntax errors.
-  `Verify` that the output is correct (no test runs for this Practicum)
